If your application manually loads Content using the fatsecret Platform API you must add fatsecret attribution in every place that Content is provided or displayed through your application. You can satisfy this by adding a fatsecret Web Badge or Attribution Snippet to your application in every place that Content is provided or displayed which explains to your users what drives your application and also ensures that you comply with the attribution requirements of the fatsecret Platform API Terms of Use . In addition if you require users to log in to your application there must be fatsecret attribution in at least one place that is accessible without a user logging in. The Web Badges or Attribution Snippet should only be used if your application uses or was created with fatsecret Platform API and it will make it easier for us to locate your application and promote you.

There is a fatsecret Platform Web Badge and formatted HTML text which can be easily included in your application. To comply with the fatsecret Platform API Terms of Use, you must display a Web Badge or Attribution Snippet on your Application and failure to comply with usage guidelines may result in termination of your licenses to use the fatsecret Platform API.

To add the attribution, include a link to the Web Badge image, or copy the HTML code for insertion into your Application.
